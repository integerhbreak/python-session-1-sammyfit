# Task:
# Calculate the area of a circle using radius and pi stored in variables.

# Your code goes here

# create a vairable pi and store value as 3.14
pi = 3.14

# create a variable radius and  store value as 5
radius = 5

# area of circle 
area = pi * radius * radius

# print "area of cricle is : "
print('area of circle is :',area)
